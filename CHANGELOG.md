# GitFourchette version history

## 1.3.0 (2025-05-03)

**Upgrade note:** The terminal command template now requires the `$COMMAND` argument placeholder. Please review your terminal command in *Settings → External Tools → Terminal*.

New features:

- Custom terminal commands (Settings → Custom Commands) (#37).
- Sidebar: Hide All But This (#49). You can now show a single branch and hide all others.
- Add file to .gitignore or .git/info/exclude from untracked file context menu (#42)

Quality of life improvements:

- GraphView: Conjoined refboxes when a local branch is in sync with its upstream (#12)
- Add target branch shorthand to default merge commit message (#39)
- NewBranchDialog: Pre-tick upstream checkbox if branching off remote branch
- Report mandatory placeholder token errors when launching external tool commands
- Speed up remote listing and upstream lookup
- Fix Sidebar/DiffArea would sometimes jump around by a few pixels while temporary banners were shown
- Override Yaru icon theme's "scary" red warning icon (#27)
- More helpful message if Python bindings for QtSvg are missing

Bug fixes:

- Sidebar: Strip initial slash in nested RefFolder display names (#45)
- Fix Ctrl+G keyboard shortcut on GNOME
- Work around window snapping issue on GNOME (#50)

Two other bug fixes originally introduced in v1.2.0 had been dormant until now due to depending on a pygit2 version bump – they are now in full effect:

- Fix push progress wasn't reported properly during transfer (requires pygit2 1.18.0) (#22)
- Fix push couldn't be canceled once the transfer starts (requires pygit2 1.18.0) (#22)

## 1.2.1 (2025-03-05)

User-suggested quality of life improvements:

- GraphView: Copy commit message from context menu (#33)
- Rephrase some messages (diff too large, delete untracked file) (#27, #28)
- Add Ptyxis terminal preset (#18)

Other quality of life improvements:

- Friendlier messages related to 'autocrlf' and 'safecrlf' options (#30)
- Flatpak distribution: Detach terminal process from application
- Improve contrast between enabled/disabled SVG icons throughout the UI
- Pasting a multiline commit message into CommitDialog's summary input box will correctly split the message across the summary and description boxes

Bug fixes:

- Fix error when an external program converts line endings in the workdir with 'autocrlf' (#30)
- Flatpak distribution: Fix terminal spawned in incorrect working directory (#18)
- Flatpak distribution: Fix Flatpak tool existence check
- Gracefully handle destruction of parent widget of external tool processes

## 1.2.0 (2025-02-19)

New features:

- Open terminal in workdir (#18)

User-suggested quality of life improvements:

- Reword "Uncommitted changes" to "Working directory" to clear up any confusion when there are no changes (#13)
- Always display the number of uncommitted changes in the sidebar and in the graph; update this whenever the app returns to the foreground (#13)
- Reword "Discard Changes" context menu entry for untracked files to "Delete File" (#17)
- Global ref sorting setting (#20)
- Allow creating a merge commit without fast-forwarding (#21)
- Dark mode readability tweaks (#24)
- Command line: Open arbitrary nested paths in a repo (#25)

Other quality of life improvements:

- Improve consistency of ellipses in menus to signify that an action can be canceled
- Warn user if an external Flatpak isn't installed when attempting to run it (merge tool, terminals, etc.)
- Remind user about any unstaged files when about to create an empty commit
- Allow middle-clicking to quickly stage/unstage selected lines in DiffView (enable in Settings → Advanced → Middle-click)
- Allow clearing draft commit messages by right-clicking the top row in GraphView
- After pushing a branch that doesn't track an upstream, PushDialog will suggest the remote branch you used previously (instead of defaulting to the first one in the repo)
- Pulling will automatically fast-forward if possible without an extra confirmation step, unless your git config contains "pull.ff=false" (behavior aligned to vanilla git). If fast-forwarding isn't possible, you will still be prompted to merge.
- Push/fetch status text uses the 'tnum' OpenType feature to avoid transfer rate numbers jumping around if your system font has digits with uneven widths
- AppImage distribution now compatible with fuse3

Bug fixes:

- Fix crash when closing several repos in quick succession, e.g. by holding down Ctrl+W
- Fix clicking the help button used to close the fast-forward dialog
- Fix DiffView out of sync with rest of RepoWidget after hiding a the currently-selected branch tip
- Fix italics in sidebar didn't update after changing the current branch's upstream (a remote-tracking branch in italics means it's the upstream for the current branch)
- Fix visual artifacts around character-level diffs in DiffView
- Fix push progress wasn't reported properly during transfer (requires pygit2 1.18.0) (#22)
- Fix push couldn't be canceled once the transfer starts (requires pygit2 1.18.0) (#22)

Breaking changes:

- The keyboard shortcut for "Go to Working Directory" is now Ctrl+G (formerly Ctrl+U, for "Uncommitted Changes"). On most keyboard layouts, Ctrl+G pairs nicely with Ctrl+H for "Go to HEAD".

## 1.1.1 (2025-01-19)

New features:

- Option to remember passphrases in encrypted keyfiles (#15)

Quality of life improvements:

- Omit remote name from refboxes when there's just 1 remote (#11)
- Display blob hashes in FileList tooltips
- GraphView tries to use the 'tnum' OpenType feature to align ISO-8601 dates if your system font has digits with uneven widths
- In commit/filename SearchBars, don't re-trigger a search if appending to a word that is known to have no occurrences

Bug fixes:

- Fix custom key file feature in CloneDialog and AddRemote
- Fix remote branch context menu in a repo with an unborn head
- GraphSplicer: Fix discrete branch may vanish from graph if moved past another branch by topological sorting
